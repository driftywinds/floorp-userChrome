# my userChrome.css file for Floorp browser (works on any Firefox based browser)
## DEPRECIATED, NOT SUPPORTED ANYMORE
Just a backup of my floorp userChrome.css file with the exact way of replicating my preferred setup whenever I need to.

Instructions: - 
- Go to about:config in your URL bar, search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and set it to true.
- Go to about:profiles in your URL bar, click /”Open Directory”/ next to your Root Directory under your default profile.
- If there is no chrome folder, create it.
- Create a file called userChrome.css inside the chrome folder.
- Copy and paste the contents of userChrome.css into your file
- Go to Floorp settings and turn on Tree Style Tabs extension toggle (and vertical tab toggle if needed).
- Restart Floorp
